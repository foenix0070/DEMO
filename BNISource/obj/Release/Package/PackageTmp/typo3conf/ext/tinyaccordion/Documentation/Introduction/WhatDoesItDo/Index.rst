What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A very easy to use extension to display content elements (tt\_content), pages and content elements or
news elements as an accordion. Put some text-content-
elements (with pictures) or news-records into a folder and this
extension will display them all as an accordion. The extension is
flexible too, because it can be configured and you can use other
JavaScript plugins too (e.g. jQuery UI Accordion).
Supported tt\_content elements: text, textpic, textmedia and table.
By default every template can be used with TinyAccordion or jQuery UI Accordion (you need to include this file by your own).
Could be used for FAQs. It uses the TinyAccordion-JavaScript file from a website, that does not exist anymore.
