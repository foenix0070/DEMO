Configuration
=============

Target group: **Developers**

Most configuration settings can be set through the flexform settings of a :ref:`plugin <configuration-plugin>`.
As not every configuration is needed for every view, the not needed are hidden.
Every setting can also be set using :ref:`TypoScript <configuration-typoscript>`.

.. important::

   The settings of the plugin always override the ones from TypoScript.
