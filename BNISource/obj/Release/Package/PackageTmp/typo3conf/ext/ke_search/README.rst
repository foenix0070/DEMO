=========

ke_search is a search engine for the TYPO3 content management system.

It offers fulltext search and faceting possibilities. Faceting means you
can narrow down your search results by selecting certain categories,
called facets or filter options.

It is very flexible: By writing your own indexer you can put any content
you want into the index.

ke_search comes with strong defaults and with very little configuration.
You can have a powerful search engine in your TYPO3 website, eg. images in
the search result list and faceting without templating or coding.

ke_search does not use frontend crawling but fetches content elements and data
records directly from the database. For the most used content types indexers
are provided within the extension itself, including pages and news.

Testing
~~~~~~~

Manual testing
..............

To test manually if your code is working, set up a TYPO3 instance for testing
and symlink or deploy the directory `ke_search` to your TYPO3 test instance to
`typo3conf/ext/ke_search`. If you deploy the code (e.g. by using PHPStorm
"Deployment" feature), you can ignore the `.Build` directory.

There are also ome helpers available to test your automatically, see below.

Unit Tests
..........

To run the unit tests:

```
composer test:unit
```

PHPStan
.......

To check the code with PHPStan

```
composer test:phpstan
```

This will create a file `phpstan-report.log` which contains the errors.

PHP Code Style Fixer
....................

To check the code with php-cs-fixer

```
composer test:php-cs-fixer
```

This will create a file `php-cs-fixer-report.log` which contains the errors.

To fix the code styling according to the TYPO3 coding guidelines automatically
run

```
.Build/bin/php-cs-fixer fix
```

Automated tests in GitHub Actions
---------------------------------

The automated tests are automatically executed after a push or a merge
request by GitHub Actions.
