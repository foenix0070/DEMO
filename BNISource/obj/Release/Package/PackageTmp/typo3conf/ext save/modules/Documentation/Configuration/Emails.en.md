# Emails

There are 2 ways that a user can register:
1. Simple 2-step registration process (user registration form and confirmation link in email).
2. Registration where user account is activated by the site administrator.

## Simple registration

## Registration Email

An email is sent to a new user when they register. The email contains an activation link (double opt-in) which the user clicks to activate their account

## Registration confirmed by site administrator

Registration consists of three steps:

1. The user registers using a form and receives an email with a confirmation link. (See Simple registration > Registration Email)
2. After the user has confirmed their registration the site administrator receives an email with 2 options (links) 
    1. Confirm registration
    2. Reject registration
3. The user is informed of the site administrator's decision by email.
